## üß† Project Overview

This work presents lightweight, interpretable machine learning models capable of predicting **respiratory and cardiovascular deterioration up to 15 minutes in advance** during interhospital transport of critically ill children.

- Trained on high-frequency physiological data from **1,519** transports
- Best models use **transformer architectures** with vector-embedded diagnoses
- Designed for **real-time deployment** on edge devices
- Integrated Gradients used for interpretability

> For full details, see the manuscript (forthcoming).
